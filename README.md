# Intermittent Empty FlatList Rendering in React Native

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList component in React Native intermittently renders an empty list even when data is successfully fetched.  The issue seems to be related to asynchronous operations and data updates within the component's lifecycle.

## Problem Description

The `DataList` component fetches data from a JSONPlaceholder API. While the data is successfully fetched and logged to the console, the FlatList often renders as empty. This behavior is inconsistent, appearing randomly.

## Solution

The solution involves using a more robust method of data handling to ensure the FlatList receives updates consistently.  This is achieved by adding a check to the render method to ensure data is not null or undefined before rendering the list.
